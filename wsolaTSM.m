% WSOLA (Waveform Similarity Overlap-add) is a time-scale modification
% algorithm. It rescales the time-axis of the input signal x according to
% the time-stretch function s without altering the pitch of x. For more
% information see the paper "An Overlap-Add Technique Based on Waveform
% Similarity (WSOLA) for High Quality Time-Scale Modification of Speech" by
% Verhelst and Roelands.
